# **Context**

React context API, In this article you will explore what is Context API and how to use it in your React project. The Context API is a React structure that enables you to exchange unique details and assists in solving prop-drilling from all levels of your application.

## **What is Context API?**
The React Context API is a way for a React app to effectively produce global variables that can be passed around. This is the alternative to "prop drilling" or moving props from grandparent to child to parent, and so on. Context is also touted as an easier, lighter approach to state management using Redux.

Context API is a (kind of) new feature added in version 16.3 of React that allows one to share state across the entire app (or part of it) lightly and with ease.

## **React context API: How it works?**
React.createContext() is all you need. It returns a consumer and a provider. Provider is a component that as it's names suggests provides the state to its children. It will hold the "store" and be the parent of all the components that might need that store. Consumer as it so happens is a component that consumes and uses the state. More information can be found on React's documentation page

Context API will replace redux?
No. Well, not entirely.

Redux is great and came perfectly to answer the need for state management. Actually, it answered this need so well that it came to be known that you can't be a "true" React developer if you don't know your way around Redux. However, Redux has its disadvantages, and that's why it's important to know what Context API gives us that Redux doesn't:

Simplicity - When using redux people tend to manage almost all of their state in redux and it causes 2 problems:

Overhead - Why should I create/update 3 files just to add one tiny feature?
One of the significant advantages of React's one-way data binding is that it's easy to understand - A component passes state to its children. Using Redux takes it away from us.
Using Context API we can define several unrelated contexts (stores) and use each in its proper place in the app.
Important Note
Redux is just a concept. If you are comfortable with using reducers and actions and don't find hindering than you may also create reducers and actions that wrap Context API as the store as Redux's author Dan Abramov explained in his medium article about whether Redux is always required

Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.

In a typical React application, data is passed top-down (parent to child) via props, but such usage can be cumbersome for certain types of props (e.g. locale preference, UI theme) that are required by many components within an application. Context provides a way to share values like these between components without having to explicitly pass a prop through every level of the tree.

# **When to Use Context**
Context is designed to share data that can be considered “global” for a tree of React components, such as the current authenticated user, theme, or preferred language. For example, in the code below we manually thread through a “theme” prop in order to style the Button component:
```js
class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <Toolbar theme="dark" />;
  }
}

function Toolbar(props) {
  // The Toolbar component must take an extra "theme" prop
  // and pass it to the ThemedButton. This can become painful
  // if every single button in the app needs to know the theme
  // because it would have to be passed through all components.
  return (
    <div>
      <ThemedButton theme={props.theme} />
    </div>
  );
}

class ThemedButton extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <Button theme={this.props.theme} />;
  }
}
```

Using context, we can avoid passing props through intermediate elements:

```js
// Context lets us pass a value deep into the component tree
// without explicitly threading it through every component.
// Create a context for the current theme (with "light" as the default).
const ThemeContext = React.createContext('light');

class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    // Use a Provider to pass the current theme to the tree below.
    // Any component can read it, no matter how deep it is.
    // In this example, we're passing "dark" as the current value.
    return (
      <ThemeContext.Provider value="dark">
        <Toolbar />
      </ThemeContext.Provider>
    );
  }
}

// A component in the middle doesn't have to
// pass the theme down explicitly anymore.
function Toolbar() {
  return (
    <div>
      <ThemedButton />
    </div>
  );
}

class ThemedButton extends React.Component {
  // Assign a contextType to read the current theme context.
  // React will find the closest theme Provider above and use its value.
  // In this example, the current theme is "dark".
  static contextType = ThemeContext;
  render() {
    return <Button theme={this.context} />;
  }
}
```

## **Before You Use Context**
Context is primarily used when some data needs to be accessible by many components at different nesting levels. Apply it sparingly because it makes component reuse more difficult.

If you only want to avoid passing some props through many levels, component composition is often a simpler solution than context.

For example, consider a Page component that passes a user and avatarSize prop several levels down so that deeply nested Link and Avatar components can read it:
```js
<Page user={user} avatarSize={avatarSize} />
// ... which renders ...
<PageLayout user={user} avatarSize={avatarSize} />
// ... which renders ...
<NavigationBar user={user} avatarSize={avatarSize} />
// ... which renders ...
<Link href={user.permalink}>
  <Avatar user={user} size={avatarSize} />
</Link>
```

It might feel redundant to pass down the user and avatarSize props through many levels if in the end only the Avatar component really needs it. It’s also annoying that whenever the Avatar component needs more props from the top, you have to add them at all the intermediate levels too.

One way to solve this issue without context is to pass down the Avatar component itself so that the intermediate components don’t need to know about the user or avatarSize props:

```js
function Page(props) {
  const user = props.user;
  const userLink = (
    <Link href={user.permalink}>
      <Avatar user={user} size={props.avatarSize} />
    </Link>
  );
  return <PageLayout userLink={userLink} />;
}

// Now, we have:
<Page user={user} avatarSize={avatarSize} />
// ... which renders ...
<PageLayout userLink={...} />
// ... which renders ...
<NavigationBar userLink={...} />
// ... which renders ...
{props.userLink}
```

With this change, only the top-most Page component needs to know about the Link and Avatar components’ use of user and avatarSize.

This inversion of control can make your code cleaner in many cases by reducing the amount of props you need to pass through your application and giving more control to the root components. Such inversion, however, isn’t the right choice in every case; moving more complexity higher in the tree makes those higher-level components more complicated and forces the lower-level components to be more flexible than you may want.

You’re not limited to a single child for a component. You may pass multiple children, or even have multiple separate “slots” for children, as documented here:
```js
function Page(props) {
  const user = props.user;
  const content = <Feed user={user} />;
  const topBar = (
    <NavigationBar>
      <Link href={user.permalink}>
        <Avatar user={user} size={props.avatarSize} />
      </Link>
    </NavigationBar>
  );
  return (
    <PageLayout
      topBar={topBar}
      content={content}
    />
  );
}
```

This pattern is sufficient for many cases when you need to decouple a child from its immediate parents. You can take it even further with render props if the child needs to communicate with the parent before rendering.

However, sometimes the same data needs to be accessible by many components in the tree, and at different nesting levels. Context lets you “broadcast” such data, and changes to it, to all components below. Common examples where using context might be simpler than the alternatives include managing the current locale, theme, or a data cache.

## **API**
## **React.createContext**

```js
const MyContext = React.createContext(defaultValue);
```

Creates a Context object. When React renders a component that subscribes to this Context object it will read the current context value from the closest matching Provider above it in the tree.

The defaultValue argument is only used when a component does not have a matching Provider above it in the tree. This default value can be helpful for testing components in isolation without wrapping them. Note: passing undefined as a Provider value does not cause consuming components to use defaultValue.
